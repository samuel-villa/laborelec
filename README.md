# Laborelec - Programming test – on PC

## 1.1. Exercise Prog-1
Write a program in Python that takes a string as input (given by the user), and returns the length of the longest sequence of identical characters found in the string. For example, longestRun(“abcd”) returns 1, longestRun(“abcaaad”) returns 3, longestRun(“a simple string with aaaabbbcccdddd”) returns 4.

Provide all the needed files to run the program on a machine with Python installed, with a README file.

Bonus: write unit tests.

$ python3 laborelec.py input_text
